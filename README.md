# jasal

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/llnek/jasal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/llnek/jasal)

A set of useful java classes (mainly interfaces) used by my other
projects, such as `project wabbit`.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

    [io.czlab/jasal "1.0.0"]

## Usage

Simply import the wanted classes into your clojure code, for example:

```clojure
(ns demo.core
  (:import [czlab.jasal CU]))

(defn shuffleInput 
  ^String
  [^String someString]
  (CU/shuffle someString))

```
